# Plone development buildout
# It will install your plone in debug mode and a bunch of debug tools.
# Launch it:
# bin/buildout -c buildout-dev.cfg
# or minimerge -NuUvR mars-light
# Look at the base buildout: ./etc/base.cfg for other details of your plone installation


# We want the production buildout + the debug bits.
